# My Computer Information
This is a script to use in a Self Service policy in Jamf to give the user some basic computer info to relay to IT. The script grabs the computer name, logged in user, IP address, and it tells the user what phone number to call for IT support. This information is automatically copied to the clipboard to make it easier to relay this info to IT.
